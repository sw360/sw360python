This Python project implements the REST API of [SW360](https://www.eclipse.org/sw360/)
and allows an easy way to interact with SW360.

## Usage

### Installation

This project is available as [Python package on PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/sw360/).  
Install fossology and required dependencies:
```shell
  pip install sw360 requests
  ```

### Using the API

* Get a REST API token from your SW360 server
* Export required environment variables (optionally but recommended):

  ```shell
  export SW360ProductionToken=<your_api_token>
  ```
* Start using the API:

  ```python
  import sw360
  client = sw360.SW360(sw360_url, sw360_api_token)
  ```

### Contribute

* All contributions in form of bug reports, feature requests or merge requests!
* Use proper [docstrings](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) to document functions and classes
* Extend the testsuite **poetry run pytest** with the new functions/classes
* The **documentation website** can automatically be generated by the [Sphinx autodoc extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html)

### Build

#### Building the Documentation

The documentation of the project is built using Sphinx:

```python
poetry run sphinx-build .\docs build\
```

#### Building Python package

For building the library, you need [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). The build is then triggered using

```shell
poetry build
```

This creates the source and wheel files in ```dist/``` subdirectory -- which can then be uploaded or installed locally using ```pip```.

## Test

Start the complete test suite or a specific test case (and generate coverage report):
```shell
poetry run pytest
```

or
```shell
poetry run coverage run -m pytest
poetry run coverage report -m --omit "*/site-packages/*.py"
poetry run coverage html --omit "*/site-packages/*.py"
```

## Demo ##

The script ``check_project.py`` shows how to use the library to retrieve some information of a given project on SW360. This requires colorama>=0.4.1.
